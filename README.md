# NHS Trust Financial Analytics

> **The NHS sector moved from a £1.6bn surplus in 2021/22 to a £1.6bn deficit in 2023/24 — a £3.2bn swing in two years.**
> This project builds an end-to-end analytics pipeline to surface that story from raw NHS England public data.

---

## What this project is

An end-to-end financial analytics pipeline using **real NHS England Trust Accounts Consolidation (TAC) data**, covering **206 NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts** across **three financial years (2021/22 – 2023/24)**.

It models the work of an NHS Trust finance analytics function: ingesting annual accounts data, computing sector KPIs against NHS FReM conventions, and producing board-ready outputs in Power BI.

## Key findings

| Metric | 2021/22 | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Total NHS income | £110.3bn | £118.4bn | £129.2bn |
| Total NHS expenditure | £108.7bn | £118.2bn | £130.8bn |
| Sector operating surplus / (deficit) | **+£1.6bn** | +£148m | **−£1.6bn** |
| Trusts in deficit | 37 of 211 | 85 of 207 | **124 of 206** |
| Average EBITDA margin | 4.6% | 4.3% | 3.6% |

**The headline:** Pay inflation following the 2023 Agenda for Change uplift, combined with clinical supply cost pressures, drove expenditure growth of 10.7% in 2023/24 against income growth of 9.1%. More than half of all NHS Trusts ended 2023/24 in deficit — the worst collective financial position since NHS provider finance reporting began in its current form.

## NHS domain coverage

This project applies real NHS finance conventions throughout:

| Convention | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| NHS Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) | IFRS-aligned chart of accounts, SoCI structure |
| TAC worksheet mapping | TAC02 (I&E) · TAC08 (expenditure) · TAC09 (workforce) |
| NHS period labels | M01 (April) → M12 (March); financial year not calendar year |
| ODS organisation codes | 3-character provider codes (`org_code`) across all dimensions |
| Agenda for Change pay context | Pay as % of income KPI; WTE cost benchmarking |
| EBITDA margin RAG thresholds | ≥2% Green · 0–2% Amber · <0% Red (NHS England standard) |

---

## Technical skills demonstrated

| Skill | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| Data engineering | Python pipeline ingesting 6 NHS Excel TAC files (~170MB) into MySQL |
| Dimensional modelling | Star schema: `dim_trust` · `dim_financial_year` · `dim_worksheet` · `dim_subcode` → `fct_tac` (2.18M rows) |
| SQL analytics | Analytical views for I&E, expenditure, workforce, KPIs, and sector scorecard |
| Data quality | 10-query validation suite with expected-value assertions |
| Financial KPIs | EBITDA margin · Pay % of income · Cost per WTE · Budget variance · CIP achievement |
| Power BI | 8-CSV export pipeline · DAX measures · 5-page dashboard |
| NHS domain knowledge | TAC subcode taxonomy · FReM conventions · sector benchmarks · ICB hierarchy |

## Database schema

Two MySQL databases:

**`nhs_stg`** — staging layer

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stg_tac_raw` | Raw ingest from all 6 TAC Excel files |
| `stg_provider_list` | ODS provider reference |

**`nhs_finance`** — analytics layer

| Table / View | Rows | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dim_trust` | 215 | Provider master — ODS code, sector, region, trust type |
| `fct_tac` | 2,179,740 | Fact table: one row per org / year / subcode / data type |
| `v_income_expenditure` | 624 | I&E per trust per year (SoCI — TAC02) |
| `v_expenditure_breakdown` | 624 | Pay / non-pay / drugs / depreciation split (TAC08) |
| `v_workforce` | 624 | Staff costs and WTE (TAC09) |
| `v_kpis` | 624 | Computed KPIs with RAG status |
| `v_trust_annual_scorecard` | 624 | Wide view combining all metrics |

## Reproduce from scratch

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ · MySQL 8.0+ · NHS TAC Excel files in `data/raw/`

```bash
# 1. Create schema and seed dimensions
#    Run sql/schema/create_tables_mysql.sql in MySQL Workbench or DbVisualizer

# 2. Ingest all 6 NHS TAC files (~10 minutes)
python python/ingestion/load_tac_data.py

# 3. Validate the load
#    Run sql/views/v_validation_checks.sql — 10 queries with expected values

# 4. Export for Power BI
python python/reporting/export_for_powerbi.py
#    Writes 8 CSVs to data/processed/powerbi_export/

# 5. Build the dashboard
#    Follow power_bi/setup_guide.md
```

**Python dependencies:** `pandas` · `sqlalchemy` · `pymysql` · `openpyxl`

## Data notes

- Source: [NHS England TAC publications](https://www.england.nhs.uk/financial-accounting-reporting-systems/nhs-england-finance-returns-publications-guidance/trust-accounts-consolidation-tac/) — publicly available, updated annually
- Each annual file includes Prior Year (PY) rows; the pipeline retains Current Year (CY) only to prevent double-counting
- Total WTE (`STA0410`) is the reliable workforce metric; WTE by staff group has subcode ambiguity in the TAC format
- 2021/22 source files use slightly different column naming (`Organisation Name` with space; `Value number`) — handled in the ingestion layer
